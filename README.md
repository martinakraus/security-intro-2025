# Hack-Proof Your App: A Hands-On Web Security Workshop

In this hands-on workshop, you’ll learn the fundamentals of web security through real-world scenarios and up-to-date best practices. We’ll start with the OWASP Top 10 and explore common vulnerabilities such as injection attacks (e.g., XSS, SQL Injection), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), authentication failures, and broken access control, with a special focus on the risks surrounding access tokens and OAuth. Of course, it’s not just about the attacks — we’ll focus especially on effective defense strategies, including:

- Secure data handling through sanitization.
- Using Content Security Policy (CSP).
- Safe handling of cookies and their attributes.
- Proper validation of access tokens.

You'll immediately put your knowledge into practice! With hands-on examples in an Angular application, you’ll get to try out and apply the concepts live. This workshop is ideal for developers who want to protect their applications against security vulnerabilities better and provides a solid foundation for securing modern web applications.
